## What is JellyChat?

JellyChat is a QA-bot (question/answering program) that answers questions about DeFiChain.

## How does it work?

JellyChat uses all information existing in DeFiChainWiki to answer your questions. Under the hood, it uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate human-like answers.

## How can I help?

### An answer is incorrect

If JellyChat answers your question incorrectly, there might be incomplete or outdated information in the wiki. Try to search the wiki using the search bar on the top right. If you find the location where JellyChat got the wrong information, you can help by fixing the information in the wiki. You can read more about how to contribute to the wiki in the [Contribution Guide](/docs/auto/Contribute.md).

### It could not answer

If JellyChat could not answer your question, the information to answer your question is not available in the wiki. You can help by adding the information to the wiki or [creating a new issue](https://github.com/0ptim/DeFiChainWiki/issues/new) in the GitHub repository, so we can add the information.
