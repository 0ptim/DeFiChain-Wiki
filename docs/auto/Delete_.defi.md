Here I describe a solution that works from time to time when the DeFi wallet does not start correctly. Sometimes even this approach does not work. First, please make sure you have a secure backup.

Go to the .defi folder and delete the contents (or move the contents to another location)

Windows: `C:\Users\%username%\.defi`

Mac: `/Users/%username%/.defi`

Delete or move content
![Delete or move content](./../media/210318_1607.png)

If you can't find the .defi folder, this text may help: [Show hidden folders](./Show_hidden_folders.md)

Then restart the computer and open the DeFi Wallet. Partly this trick works. If not we can only recommend to delete everything (except backup) and reinstall the app.
