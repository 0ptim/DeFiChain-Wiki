be fully in control of their finances. While it seems like a simple and
obvious statement, the current systems are far from providing financial
services that are truly under the control of the people who use them.
The mission of DeFiChain is to give people (and in the future, machines,
and devices) seamless access to decentralized financial services.</p><p>For that purpose, we are introducing DeFiChain, a dedicated blockchain
specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) <a href="http://www.DeFichain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.DeFichain.com</a>.</p><p>By dedicating the functionality of a blockchain specifically to
decentralized finance, DeFiChain provides high transaction throughput,
reduced risk of errors, and intelligent feature development specifically
for the fulfillment of Satoshi’s original intent: To create a reliable
alternative form of financial services built on top of Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, as described in the original Satoshi whitepaper, is designed as
a form of digital cash, as a store and exchange of value. The evolution
to Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed for tremendous new
functionalities to be built on top of a blockchain, yet this development
has come at a cost. The concept of one global operating system for
everything has created a system that requires a complex codebase for
smart contracts, slow throughput, and difficulty around the governance
of the system.</p><p>DeFiChain approaches decentralized finance as a specific and critical
segment of the blockchain community. DeFi is a dedicated blockchain that
is optimized specifically for DeFi applications. DeFiChain is
intentionally non-Turing-Complete and does not support any function,
other than those needed for Decentralized Finance, resulting in a
blockchain that provides higher throughput and better functionality
specifically for dApps related to finance. The advantage of a non-Turing
complete command set is that there is a much lower potential for coding
errors of the type that have plagued Ethereum smart contracts such as
with the DAO hack or the locked funds with Parity. While it is important
that we have some smart contract languages that are Turing complete, in
the area of finance, it is appropriate to restrict the capabilities of
the language in favor of a more secure system with greatly-reduced
attack vectors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The Problem<a class="hash-link" href="#the-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Today, almost all financial services are run by banks. Investments, for
example, by definition, is the use of capital to earn more capital.
Investors use a bank to put their money into interest or dividend-making
instruments in order to grow their wealth. The problems with financial
services are increasingly becoming obvious to everyone: compounded costs
due to middle(wo)men, slow transactions, delays for cross-border
transactions, and inaccessibility to many sectors of the population. A
myriad of fintech solutions have been brought in to improve the system,
but fundamentally the underlying banking system is still in control, so
fintech has brought only limited improvements.</p><p>Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offer a way to start
with a new system, circumventing the difficulties faced in changing the
finance industry. While crypto has attracted billions in investments,
decentralized financial services are lagging. When it comes to
investment in cryptocurrency, crypto investors can buy and sell, but
that’s it. The cryptocurrency itself cannot be invested in the same way
fiat currency can be. Initial attempts to create peer-to-peer lending
and asset tokenization so far have proven partial and unreliable, so
investors have extremely limited options when it comes to an investment
of their cryptoassets. The potential is enormous to provide financial
services in crypto, the same way they are offered in fiat currency.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The Solution<a class="hash-link" href="#the-solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DeFiChain is designed for investors in the cryptocurrency market who are
looking to make their cryptocurrency work just like any other form of
capital, such that they can ensure a return on investment in any market.
DeFiChain is a dedicated non-Turing-complete blockchain, designed
specifically for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. DeFi
provides full functionality for this specific segment of the DLT
community, sacrificing other types of functionality for simplicity,
rapid throughput, and security.</p><p>The function set includes among others:</p><ul><li>Decentralized lending</li><li>Decentralized wrapping of tokens</li><li>Decentralized Pricing oracles</li><li>Decentralized exchanges</li><li>Transferable debts and receivables</li><li>Decentralized Non-collateralized debt</li><li>Asset tokenization</li><li>Distribution of Dividends</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="timeline">Timeline<a class="hash-link" href="#timeline" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_1_Roadmap-50863d3ca30f0d0f530fca6e95fd847a.png" width="1200" height="1120" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backgroundindustry">Background/Industry<a class="hash-link" href="#backgroundindustry" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defis-promises-and-challenges">DeFi’s promises and challenges<a class="hash-link" href="#defis-promises-and-challenges" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Decentralized Finance promises to provide a variety of financial
instruments without the need for middle(wo)men to ensure that the
services are trusted. According to the OECD, financial services
typically make up 20–30% of total service market revenue and about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20%
of the total gross domestic
product</a> in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developed
economies</a>
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030515/what-percentage-global-economy-comprised-financial-services-sector.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>.
This is an enormous industry dedicated to one thing: making sure that
financial transactions are trusted. With the advent of blockchain,
trustless systems and smart contracts can be used to replace much of the
functionality of this industry, dramatically increasing the return on
investment for the individual investor.</p><p>Financial services today are providing an important service, but at a
very high cost, and despite many fintech developments, the following
underlying issues persist:</p><ul><li>High transaction costs. Due to regulatory requirements, legacy systems
with complex interoperability issues, and control by large
institutions, transaction fees are high for the average user of
banking and financial services. Services that require a broker are
even more expensive, as agents and other types of middlemen are
involved.</li><li>Slow transactions, particularly for international transactions.
Although theoretically, it should only take minutes for computers to
transact, moving money from one institution to another can take hours
within a country, and it can take days between countries.</li><li>Lack of transparency and unfair advantages to large players. Financial
instruments are complex and most people do not have access to the
information that would allow them to make optimal decisions. Lack of
transparency is one of the major factors that led to the 2008
financial crisis and in the short term, it always leaves smaller
investors (the average person) at a disadvantage compared to
institutional investors.</li><li>Inaccessibility and/or higher cost to lower-income people. Financial
services are simply not available in many geographies, and when they
are, lower-income people are hit with even higher fees
(percentage-wise) than average.</li><li>Despite legislation to reduce money laundering and related crimes,
there is almost no evidence to suggest the current system or AML is,
in fact, reducing money laundering.</li></ul><p>Fintech has been attempting to address these problems, with some
success. Fintech solutions such as online international transfer
services, savings, and investment apps, and mobile money for underserved
markets have begun to improve the situation. However, the change is
incremental, and is still built on top of a system that fundamentally
requires the overhead of agents to provide trust. While some of the
costs can be reduced, fundamentally, fintech can’t address the
underlying issues of lack of transparency because it is dealing in the
same financial instruments and going through the same major institutions
as traditional finance.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_2_2019-defi-14864a4a84ecd9168ccac34ffdac6d81.png" width="1200" height="708" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For this reason, many investors have begun moving parts of their investments
into cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency, by definition has full transparency
that traditional systems simply cannot provide. Furthermore, the amount
of administration and bureaucracy required is minimal. Most of the
activities that were carried out by agents can be written into the code
in decentralized financial systems. Of course, there is still some
overhead in creating and maintaining the code, as well as maintenance of
the networks, but the amount of bureaucracy is minimal, eliminating much
of the cost of transacting on these systems.</p><p>Despite the promise of decentralized finance, the technology is still
nascent, and there are many opportunities to create a richer and more
robust decentralized finance environment. To date, investors in
cryptocurrency have extremely limited investment options. Promises of
peer-to-peer lending platforms, asset tokenization and other types of
blockchains have either failed to deliver, been hacked, or delivered a
pared-down version of the original promise.</p><p>Today, almost universally, cryptocurrency investors have only one way to
earn money on their capital: rise of the cryptocurrency asset. While in
the short term, this may be a good investment, it’s not how currency is
designed to work. The investment of capital should provide a return on
investment, and cryptocurrency is designed to be like any other form of
currency. Investors today want the possibility to lend, invest, and
receive returns on their cryptocurrency investments. Well-designed DeFi
platforms should allow the development of a variety of safe and secure
financial instruments for the investment of cryptocurrency.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_3_Be-your-own-bank-064c813f467ee1684cc9c50b66dc103c.png" width="1200" height="824" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-state-of-defi">The state of DeFi<a class="hash-link" href="#the-state-of-defi" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The current state of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is populated by
general purpose blockchains, most of which provide Turing-complete
command sets for the development of smart contracts on the chain. While
appropriate for many programming languages, this dogmatic pursuit of
Turing-complete smart contracts languages has resulted in a variety of
problems when it comes to scalability, security and robustness of the
blockchains.</p><ul><li>The sheer mass of dApps on networks such as Ethereum, EOS and TRON
have potential (or proven) impact on other dApps on the network. The
most obvious example was when CryptoKitties ground the Ethereum
network practically to a halt. While some of the faster-throughput
networks say this can’t happen, it will be some time before any other
network reaches the critical mass of apps on Ethereum so that we can
prove whether this is or isn’t the case.</li><li>For serious financial type dApps, it’s important to know that the
network is being maintained and managed in a responsible and secure
manner. Having a blockchain that is swamped with games, gambling and
other types of less “mission critical” apps will ultimately influence
the development and direction of the blockchains. With governance
models that allocate power to masternodes, dev groups, and
token-holders, the core development team will ultimately be influenced
by the biggest players. Decentralized Finance apps can’t afford the
potential consequences of sharing a blockchain with anyone who chooses
to use that operating system.</li><li>Using Turing-complete command sets requires programmers to create
complex programs to develop any kind of app. For example, to create a
peer-to-peer lending contract on top of MakerDAO, a programmer
requires approximately 2000 lines of code. Any bug in that code can
cause loss of the funds, or some other consequence. Maintaining such a
large code base intrinsically means larger chances for mistakes and a
large attack surface for even simple apps.</li></ul><p>The limitations of general-purpose blockchains for DeFi apps has opened
up a market opportunity to serve this market. While cryptocurrency
momentum has continued to rise, most of the current applications are
still on Ethereum. Concerns about the network have already led some of
the major projects to consider porting or working with alternative or
additional blockchains.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defis-current-problems">DeFi’s current problems<a class="hash-link" href="#defis-current-problems" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Finance dApps require reliability and do not want to be associated
with blockchains that host apps such as betting, entertainment or
other apps that may tarnish the reputation of a blockchain at any
time.</li><li>Sudden increases in volume of any dApp on a blockchain can potentially
impact all the other dApps on that blockchain, either in terms of
throughput, transaction price, or additional impacts, as seen with
CryptoKitties on Ethereum.</li><li>General-purpose blockchains require a large amount of coding to
provide financial services, increasing the risk of hackability or bugs
in the code. Functionalities that are basic requirements for financial
services, such as multisig, are often difficult to implement or
missing on general-purpose blockchains.</li><li>Maintenance of a Turing-complete blockchain means that resources are
not focusing on the areas valued by DeFi apps.</li><li>Governance models of most of today’s blockchains are immature and
showing signs of politicization, centralization and uncertainty.
Without formal governance structures, the future of these blockchains
is uncertain. Recent discussions of upgrades and forks in both
Ethereum and Bitcoin have revealed the immaturity of these systems,
and even the leader in governance, Aragon, showed the vulnerability of
its on-chain governance system in the summer 2019 vote, where one
large “whale” token-holder changed the outcome of several proposal
votes at the last minute. Such vulnerabilities are unacceptable on
blockchains dealing with finance.</li><li>Regulatory standards and regulatory bodies that appropriately address
the needs of natively cross-border currencies and financial
instruments. Jurisdiction-based regulation, and regulation based on
legacy technology is falling short of the needs of the DeFi industry.
It is clear that a new legal and regulatory framework is needed to
protect the rights of people using these systems.</li><li>The blockchain industry itself has not shown the maturity to put in
place its own standards bodies that will provide best practices or
self-regulation in a way that would demonstrate the industry’s
reliability for decentralized finance applications. To date, attempts
at creating interoperability or self-regulation have been immature and
have not resulted in leadership or standards that could be adopted by
international bodies or serious regulators. The lack of
self-regulation leaves the industry even more vulnerable to regulation
from outside, making the environment risky for serious investors.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consequences-in-the-defi-market">Consequences in the DeFi Market<a class="hash-link" href="#consequences-in-the-defi-market" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Multisig wallets are the best the industry has to provide when it
comes to joint management of funds, and the solutions for multi-sig
are, to some degree, kludges. Multisig tends to be leger-specific and
not flexible for different scenarios. For example, in traditional
finance, multi-signature accounts can assign signatories different
levels of authority, or require different signatures for different
transaction types and levels. Different chains take different
approaches to adding multisig capabilities to their existing
blockchains.<ul><li>The BIP 11: M-of-N Standard Transactions is a Bitcoin Improvement
Proposal (BIP)designed to add multisig support to Bitcoin
blockchain.</li><li>Ethereum provides a Turing-complete command set for development of
multisig on chain, leading to multiple entities providing multisig
smart contracts. Bugs such as those in the Parity multisig
(discussed below) have resulted in untold sums in lost funds.</li></ul></li><li>As a result of the complexity of the code required for multisig, in
2017, more than 150,000 ETH was lost to a hack in the Parity multisig
wallet, due to an error in the code
<a href="https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>.
The referenced article notes ways in which this code bug could have
been avoided, but it emphasizes the point that these complexities in
coding cause many different attack vectors. An entire industry has
sprouted up around smart contract auditing, because the situation is
so vulnerable.</li><li>In the largest industry hack (or bug?!), The DAO was drained of 3.6
million ETH due to a coding error in the smart contract holding all of
the funds of The DAO.</li></ul><p>One of the many results is that the high risks get priced in to the
underlying contracts leading to excessive costs for users, as can be
seen when comparing rates from DeFi and non-DeFi examples. (For example
8% with decentralized DAI to 1.75% with centralized USDC (dated at the
beginning of October 2019): <a href="https://deficompare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://deficompare.com/</a>) Both coins
represent 1 USD but the decentralized version ist 6.25% more expensive
due to a priced in risk from the Ethereum contract.</p><p>The points described above are simply unacceptable for any type of
financial transaction or investor. For that reason, it’s important to
build dedicated services that will prevent such breaches, lower risks
and thus cost. In the Blockchain world, having proper programming rules
and reducing the attack vectors prevents this kind of attack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comparing-existing-defi-alternatives">Comparing existing DeFi alternatives<a class="hash-link" href="#comparing-existing-defi-alternatives" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bitcoin-why-not">Bitcoin: Why Not?<a class="hash-link" href="#bitcoin-why-not" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Given our optimism on Bitcoin, the first question one might ask is why
not develop DeFi using the Bitcoin Blockchain. While Bitcoin allows only
basic smart contracts, some projects have begun developing workarounds.
However, the transaction costs are restrictive on the Bitcoin chain, and
we don’t believe it is going to be appropriate for the speed required
for financial transactions. The Bitcoin chain is currently working as
designed as a store of value. In our opinion, sticking to that single
purpose is the best use of the chain and it is proven over the last
decade. Adding financial services into the main chain adds unnecessary
complexity and may cause side effects both for DeFi and for Bitcoin that
are undesirable. Furthermore, it is not something we think that the
Bitcoin governance is prepared to handle, and at some point, if
DeFiChain requirements differed from those of the miners or developers
on the Bitcoin chain, we would be subject to their decisions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="turing-complete-solutions-ethereum-eos-tron">Turing-complete Solutions: Ethereum, EOS, Tron…<a class="hash-link" href="#turing-complete-solutions-ethereum-eos-tron" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To date, a number of DeFi applications have been built on Ethereum,
Tron, EOS and many other turing-complete chains. Since Ethereum has the
biggest adoption it allowed the surfacing of issues that come with using
a turing-complete blockchain for DeFi applications the fastest. The DAO
hack was one of the first and most dramatic exposures of the
vulnerability of using such a complex language. Anyone issuing a token
on the network knows how difficult it is. Just to create and issue an
ERC20 token can easily cost over 100,000 USD, considering the cost of
smart contract auditing that is necessary for innovative solutions.
Simply the fact that there’s an entire industry built around “smart
contract audits” should be enough to illustrate the problem. Despite the
fact that ERC20 is the industry standard, it’s still so easy to hack
that it’s impossible to issue even a simple token without getting a
high-cost professional auditor as well as a programmer.</p><p>On an even more stark note, it’s now possible to scan for exploitable
code using automation, and a 2018 study managed to scan a million smart
contracts, finding over 34,000 hackable smart contracts
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06038.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>. It’s unfathomable that
3.4% of financial transactions would be vulnerable. While this at the
moment seems to be a problem mainly centered around Ethereum, we believe
most other turing-complete chains will experience the same issues once
more use cases get adopted on top of them.</p><p>The second problem stays mostly within Ethereum, which is the network’s
usage being already close to maximum capacity. It simply does not seem
feasible to use the network for all of the decentralized finance
applications. Ethereum’s market cap is a tenth of that of Bitcoin. If
the system is already near capacity, it’s hard to see how it can manage
the capacity of becoming a true DeFi network for the rest of the
ecosystem. Something Vitalik Buterin has acknowledged in an interview:
<a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-founders-admit-never-designed-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-founders-admit-never-designed-scalability/&gt;.</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_4_Graph-5356ba4a5a35634d1c4978defa3a4754.png" width="1177" height="502" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defichain-solution">DeFiChain Solution<a class="hash-link" href="#defichain-solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staying-in-the-bitcoin-ecosystem">Staying in the Bitcoin Ecosystem<a class="hash-link" href="#staying-in-the-bitcoin-ecosystem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The cryptocurrency market as a whole is difficult to predict. Most of
the coins have become valueless, and it remains to be seen how the
system will sustain itself after cash runs out from many of the major
ICOs.</p><p>Despite this, our outlook on Bitcoin specifically is extremely
optimistic. Over the last year, through market volatility, including
instability in traditional financial markets, Bitcoin has retained its
value, demonstrated its impermeability to attack and hackers, and gained
increasing respect from traditional financial players.</p><p>Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a store of value, and it is
perceived as the standard by which other cryptocurrencies are measured.
While people’s portfolios vary widely, Bitcoin remains the standard
currency that almost every crypto investor holds as a major part of
their holdings. The tremendous community and ecosystem around Bitcoin
bode well for its long-term viability as a store of value.</p><p>For that reason, creating decentralized financial services around
Bitcoin represents a tremendous opportunity that has yet been untapped,
partially because of the difficulty of creating smart contracts that
work with the Bitcoin network, and partially because of the
fractalization of the development community to many side projects. We
believe this tendency of the development community to jump on the newest
developments has drawn attention away from the real story: Bitcoin is
here to stay.</p><p>Thus, we believe, building a DeFi Blockchain on top of Bitcoin would
bring the best out of both worlds: Bitcoin’s stability and immutability
and DeFi-chain’s scalability and functionality.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-on-top-of-bitcoin">Building on Top of Bitcoin<a class="hash-link" href="#building-on-top-of-bitcoin" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the major challenges in new blockchains is creating the robust
immutability available after a critical mass of users and blocks secure
the chain. To provide immediate security and immutability of the
blockchain, DeFiChain will be anchoring itself to the bitcoin
blockchain. Every few minutes, DeFiChain saves its most recent Merkle
tree to the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to how Rootstock (Turing
Complete Smart contracts secured by Bitcoin <a href="https://www.rsk.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.rsk.co/</a>) is
planning on connecting to Bitcoin. In this fashion, the most recent
chain is always fully secure and immutable, and can be checked against
the most recent record anchored to Bitcoin. Over time, DeFiChain will
space out the anchors at larger intervals. This anchoring mechanism
ensures provably immutable records from day one and defends against
attacks, hackers and vulnerabilities that can cause concern in emerging
chains.</p><p>At the same time DeFiChain keeps its own consensus mechanism and
function set, allowing for all those characteristics that Bitcoin does
not inherently have. This is achieved by DeFiChain being a dedicated
non-Turing-complete blockchain, designed specifically for the
decentralized finance (DeFi) industry built on top of Bitcoin. DeFiChain
provides full functionality for this specific segment of the DLT
community, sacrificing other types of functionality for simplicity,
rapid throughput and security.</p><p>DeFiChain utilizes a completely decentralized Proof-of-Stake mechanism
allowing for:</p><ul><li>a massive scalable and energy conserving consensus.</li><li>fast transactions and high security</li><li>ability to create a variety of DeFi apps based on one chain, rapidly
and with very low attack surface</li><li>multi-token support on one chain through decentralized wrapped token
technology.</li><li>decentralized governance</li><li>independence of other financial systems and financial instruments.</li><li>fully liquid investments with no minimum size of investments, and no
minimum lock-up periods</li></ul><p>Unlike Ethereum or other turing-complete blockchains, DeFiChain is not a
general-purpose blockchain, and commands outside the basic set of
functions are not allowed. Limiting the allowed commands on purpose
provides a dramatically reduced attack surface for smart contracts,
eliminating the obvious breaches that are made possible when programmers
need to design complex coding for these functions. The details of these
will be described in the next section.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benefits-of-defichain-summary">Benefits of DeFiChain: Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#benefits-of-defichain-summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Development of a variety of financial operations &amp; vehicles for

without the intervention of a bank. Through collateralized systems,
decentralized lending on Ethereum reached over a quarter of a billion
dollars in 2018.</p><p>All of these systems are based on Ethereum, meaning they are addressing
only 15% of the market based on market capitalization. The DeFi platform
will be addressing the entire 100% of the market by leading with
Bitcoin, but also including the entire market through wrapping and
pooling as described below.</p><p>The major decentralized lending platforms (Compound, Dharma, dYdX, and
Maker) provide lending at rates ranging from 0.5% through 6%. Because
everything is managed through smart contracts, the overhead of banks is
eliminated, and the platforms are able to provide much better rates than
banks. As these types of decentralized lending services become safer,
it’s likely the market will also see an increase in peer-to-peer lending
opportunities through dedicated applications.</p><p>The power of decentralized lending lies in the market efficiencies
available by eliminating the middlemen and administration involved in
lending. Furthermore, with investors concerned about minimal or even
negative interest rates, decentralized lending protects the investors
from that potentiality, providing market rate interest while giving
borrowers better rates than they can get in the existing financial
markets. Given the magnitude of credit and the role it plays in the
economy as a whole, decentralized lending offers the potential for many
more initiatives to borrow money based on open markets and favorable
conditions. Easier access to lending translates into a faster-growing
economy.</p><p>Initial implementations of decentralized lending are fully
collateralized, and because of the volatility of cryptocurrency, most
platforms require double or more collateral on loans. This allows people
to take loans based on cryptocurrency they hold. They can manage their
cash flow problems without having to sell their crypto holdings, and
meanwhile get favorable conditions on the loan.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decentralized-wrapping-of-tokens">Decentralized Wrapping of Tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-wrapping-of-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An important issue for DeFi is the ability to work with a variety of
cryptoassets, directly, on-chain. While the transaction on the chain is
done via the native \$DFI coin, DeFiChain can use Bitcoin, Ethereum,
ERC-20, or any other cryptoasset through wrapping.</p><p>Wrapping allows the utilization of any digital asset such that the
underlying asset is maintained, but it can transact on a different
blockchain. DeFiChain provides a decentralized wrapping mechanism which
allows the owner of the crytpoasset to maintain pegging to the asset and
utilize a trustless wrapping mechanism that does not rely on any third
party as a guarantor of the wrapping or asset. The wrapped tokens can be
easily exchanged for their original value on their respective
blockchain.</p><p>Creating a wrapped token on DeFiChain is a rewarded activity, such that
there is incentive for cryptocurrency holders to create wrapped tokens
on the DeFi network as a form of rewarded decentralized financial
investment.</p><p>Wrapping is a key capability of DeFi due to the need for
interoperability of different types of cryptocurrencies and assets. To
date, there are no interoperability standards between different
currencies, and the only way to interoperate between currencies is by
using wrapping or collateralization, which has to be provided by a third
party. The entire point of decentralization is that people do not need
to trust an authority, yet, today that is the main way that investors
can interoperate between Bitcoin and Ethereum without converting from
one coin to the other. The Polkadot protocol provides a platform for the
development of interoperable apps, but not specifically for DeFi. As a
new protocol, it is yet to be seen how it will be leveraged.</p><p>Without wrapping, holders would need to convert their cryptoasset to the
DeFi currency in order to use the services offered. Obviously, for most
investors, that’s unacceptable. The investor has put their money into
Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever else, because that is the currency
they want to hold. The main purpose of DeFiChain is to enable financial
transactions in any type of crypto asset, such that people can use the
assets and coins they hold, as currency for investment in other types of
financial vehicles.</p><p>The decentralized wrapping function is crucial in allowing people to
hold any asset and perform investments in another currency. So, for
example, someone holding Bitcoin could make a loan to someone who wants
to borrow ETH, or someone who wants to hedge against the cryptocurrency
they have could do so using a wrapping function to use some of their
assets to purchase options in other types of assets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decentralized-pricing-oracles">Decentralized Pricing Oracles<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-pricing-oracles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DeFiChain will include pricing oracles to collect data from outside

the parameters for rewarding oracles for the data they provide.</p><p>Oracles are eventually meant to be decentralized. However, DeFiChain
will be launched with a few appointed trusted pricing oracles that
periodically submit pricing data from trusted source onto DeFiChain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decentralized-exchanges">Decentralized Exchanges<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-exchanges" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The decentralized exchange function will allow atomic swap of
cryptocurrencies in a peer-to-peer fashion
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance#Decentralized_exchanges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>. The
decentralized exchange function matches people for trading directly,
without the need to buy and sell currency through an exchange. Using
decentralized exchange reduces the risks associated with using
exchanges, and ensures that the cryptoasset doesn’t leave the
custodianship of the token-holders. It also removes the risk of
custodianship from the exchange itself, because the mechanism is
peer-to-peer based on an agreed-upon price or on the market price at the
time of the exchange.</p><p>While a number of decentralized exchanges are available on the market
today <a href="https://coinsutra.com/best-decentralized-exchanges-dex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>,
DeFiChain solution allows integration of atomic swap capabilities in
third-party applications by creating a decentralized exchange as a
service.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transferable-debts-and-receivables">Transferable Debts and Receivables<a class="hash-link" href="#transferable-debts-and-receivables" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DeFiChain will offer a set of calls to work with transferable debts and
receivables. In the centralized finance world, debts and accounts
receivable can only be managed through financial institutions that
handle loans. The lack of transparency of these transferable debts was
one of the factors leading to the financial crisis of 2008.</p><p>For small and medium enterprises, this can be a particularly powerful
tool. For example, Jane’s widget factory supplies widgets to a large car
manufacturer, but the car manufacturer pays for those widgets on a basis
of invoice +60. Meanwhile, Jane has to pay for the materials to produce
the widgets, and, of course, regular salaries to her workers on a
monthly or weekly basis. The car manufacturer will pay the invoice, but
not in time for Jane to pay all of her expenses. Without Defi, Jane
needs to go to the bank and pay whatever interest rates they demand,
because she has no alternatives. The transferable receivables function
would allow anyone to offer Jane a loan based on the receivables. Since
many people would be able to see that the car manufacturer is a low-risk
customer, and that they will pay their invoices, anyone who wants can
make an offer to Jane for a better rate than the bank, creating a
competitive market for debts and receivables based on the real risk and
market assessment of that risk. Jane now can get a loan with great
rates, and the lenders, likewise get excellent returns on their loans,
despite the fact that they are loaning the money for only 30-60 days.</p><p>Blockchain adds transparency to the exchange of debts and loans based on
receivables or other types of financial promises. DeFiChain will include
the capability for organizations to create smart contracts that allow
straightforward investment in such assets, so that peer-to-peer loans
can be made without the need for a financial institution to guarantee
these types of financial assets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decentralized-non-collateralized-debt">Decentralized Non-Collateralized Debt<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-non-collateralized-debt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the future, it will be possible to provide non-collateralized loans
based on the reputation and other factors about borrowers. Through
different forms of verifiable credentials, and records of an
individual’s borrowing and repayment history, non-collateralized systems
can be developed. Many of the identity solutions being developed today
are looking at anonymous and pseudonymous reputation-reporting systems,
based on a Decentralized Identifier (DID) issued by the individual, and
Verifiable Credentials (VC) issued by known authorities who are
reputable to provide information about the individual’s credit history.</p><p>The appropriate reputation based systems and risk assessment systems
will need to be built out. While this will take time, perhaps years, it
is foreseeable that this kind of system could supplement or replace
today’s credit ratings scores.</p><p>Another potential application of this feature would be the ability to
create non-collateralized decentralized stablecoins. The success of DAI
and MakerDAO show the desirability of pegged stablecoins, yet the high
level of collateralization is a deterrent to creating more such
projects. It is feasible that through market mechanisms and staking,
decentralized non-collateralized stablecoins can be created.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asset-tokenization">Asset Tokenization<a class="hash-link" href="#asset-tokenization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Asset tokenization is the representation of an asset, such as real
estate or company equity, in immutable tokens on the blockchain
<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/tokenization-assets-disrupting-financial-industry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>.
This particular area of decentralized finance has tremendous potential
and is one of the most exciting areas of investment for holders of
cryptocurrency
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencoleman/2019/04/25/heres-why-interest-in-tokenizing-assets-is-starting-to-surge/#2ddeec4640a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(link)</a>.</p><p>While several attempts have been made at asset tokenization in the
blockchain space, most of them have pivoted and now provide services not
directly related to asset tokenization (LAtoken, Etherparty). Tokeny and
Tokenize-IT advertise themselves as tokenization platforms, but as of
the writing of this paper, their processes are still fairly manual, and
are heavily reliant on specific localities and regulatory requirements
for those specific jurisdictions. Other blockchains, such as Tezos, have
been mentioned as good platforms for asset tokenization, but, as with
other multi-use blockchains, the Turing-complete set of commands will
create complex smart contracts that are unnecessary when using
DeFiChain.</p><p>DeFiChain will provide a module specifically designed for asset
tokenization, and will be particularly easy to use to tokenize assets
such as company equity, real estate, and other valued holdings.</p><p>Recently (October 2019), the Lichtenstein Blockchain law created the
legal basis upon which any asset can be tokenized and legally bound to
tokens or “containers” that represent the right to the asset. The law is
precise in its wording, describing how a container issued by a trusted
party now can hold the legal rights to the disposal over the asset.
Disposal over the asset is distinct from ownership or rights to the
asset, or even control as a specific concept. The careful wording of
this law is a breakthrough for everyone in the world of asset
tokenization, because it will now allow someone to go to a court of law
with a token and expect to have legal legitimacy for assets that are
tokenized (as long as the authority granting the token is recognized as
a trusted authority to do so). It also opens up a space for DeFiChain to
apply for this trusted status, such that the Asset Tokenization
capability described here can be offered as a decentralized, legal and
authorized capability that people can trust, without having to depend on
any centralized authority.</p><p>For more information on this law, please see Liechtenstein’s website at
<a href="https://liechtensteinusa.org/article/liechtensteins-parliament-approves-blockchain-act-unanimously" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://liechtensteinusa.org/article/liechtensteins-parliament-approves-blockchain-act-unanimously</a></p><p>Examples of assets people can now tokenize using the blockchain:</p><ul><li>Securities, such as ETF investing, stocks and shares.</li><li>Shares in privately held companies.</li><li>Energy and income generating devices, such as wind turbines, solar
farms, satellites.</li><li>Ownership in food means of production (new forms of cooperative farms
where non-farmers could own food supply instead of commodities traded
on exchanges)</li><li>Self-driving cars, vending machines, ATMs, pinball machines, and other
types of revenue-generating self-regulating devices.</li><li>DAOs (Distributed Autonomous Organizations).</li><li>Small real estate investments (time shares, short-term rental
apartments, etc.)</li><li>Large real estate investments (airports, amusement parks, apartment
complexes, business parks)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distribution-of-dividends">Distribution of Dividends<a class="hash-link" href="#distribution-of-dividends" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Any tokenized asset with return on investment can use the dividends
distribution module to create smart contracts that pay out returns on
the investment automatically. Using DeFiChain will allow a leap in the
functionality of dividends distribution. It will be possible to
implement models similar to today, where payouts are performed on a
weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, or models where payouts are on a
daily, hourly or even minute-by-minute basis.</p><p>Distribution of dividends would be relevant in any type of tokenized
asset, as described above. For example, today, a municipal government
might do a bond issue to invest in a wind turbine to supply electricity.
The government would take care of everything, and repay that bond
according to the schedule. With distribution of dividends, the community
could purchase the wind turbine directly, and distribute the dividends
to the investors in the wind turbine. Instead of going through the
administration required through the centralized authority (government),
every citizen who wanted to could invest in that wind turbine, and
dividends would be paid according to each person’s contribution to that
investment. Eliminating overhead and fair distribution of profits would
be major benefits for the community owning the wind turbine. In this
case, the wind turbine is a public good, but it could also simply be a
private investment.</p><p>Any private investment could be run this way: a pinball machine,
self-driving taxi, real estate investment, etc. Automatic distribution
of dividends reduces the need for administration and overhead, as well
as eliminating uncertainty about payouts and control by a centralized
authority.</p><p>The need for joint dividend investing is becoming increasingly relevant
with IoT. Devices are able to create tremendous value. A self-driving
car will be able to provide taxi services. Vending machines, sensors,
satellites, etc., are all potentially revenue-generating devices that
people can own together and share in the profit of together, yet until
now the legal and financial complexity of doing so has been prohibitive.
DeFi can simplify those processes.</p><p>Similarly, distribution of profits for a private company can be
implemented. One of the first experiments in this area is a DAO
(Distributed Autonomous Organization) called dOrg. dOrg is a collection
of programmers (as well as a sales/operations team) who co-own their
software house. Distribution of salaries is through a DAO that functions
as a multi-sig, such that every 2 weeks, the whole organization submits
their payment requests for work contracted, and the team votes to pass
one anothers’ salary requests. Inside dOrg, each person holds a
“reputation” that represents the percentage of ownership each person has
earned (they earn ownership according to the amount of work done since
the inception of the company). But what will happen to the profit at the
end of the year? Presumably, each individual will have to submit a
request for their percentage of the profits, and everyone will have to
vote on that, too, because the DAO does not allow for automated
distribution of profits. Using DeFiChain, the team could easily
implement a quarterly or annual function that would automatically
distribute the profits of the company to each person, according to their
holdings in the company. This scheme would work even for people who were
active in the past, but are no longer active, so they aren’t in the DAO
any longer, but they still hold a percentage based on their past
contributions. Other contributors might be an investor who puts money
into the company, but does not participate.</p><p>The examples above seem logical and straightforward, but today are
extremely time-consuming and complex. People who want to make an
investment together in companies, real estate, or other income-deriving
assets type of dividend distribution today is complex and requires a lot
of manual calculations. Through the DeFi Distribution of Dividends
functionality, it becomes not just simple, but automatic for companies
to distribute dividends to equity owners.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defichain-design">DeFiChain Design<a class="hash-link" href="#defichain-design" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-parameters">Design Parameters<a class="hash-link" href="#design-parameters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Looking at the business requirements from the chapter before, DeFiChain

Robust and Secure<a class="hash-link" href="#1-robust-and-secure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Bitcoin Core is the most robust and longest running blockchain in the
world. It has been operating with no disruptions since the genesis block
in January 2009. Furthermore, from a security standpoint, Bitcoin core
has proven itself to be most secure blockchain with no security
incidents, while securing the crypto asset with the highest valuation in
the world, that is, Bitcoin (BTC). As of this writing, Bitcoin Core
successfully secures \$150 billion worth of crypto assets, or 68% of the
crypto asset market capitalization.</p><p>The proven security and robustness of the Bitcoin Core made it the
blockchain of choice for DeFiChain base for extension. DeFiChain is
built based on a fork of Bitcoin Core 0.18, specifically v0.18.1.</p><p>DeFiChain will be written in C++, and the plan is to use other
languages, such as Rust, in the future.</p><p>While DeFiChain is a new blockchain, basing it on a Bitcoin Core fork
results in a chain that is easy to integrate with for exchanges and apps

scalability, DeFiChain fork of Bitcoin Core will include the following
improvements:</p><ul><li>Block time: 30 seconds</li><li>Block size: 16 MB</li></ul><p>These improvements provide a transaction rate of over 2,200 transactions

Decentralized Consensus Mechanism<a class="hash-link" href="#3-decentralized-consensus-mechanism" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Bitcoin Core is using Proof-of-Work (PoW) as the consensus mechanism.
DeFiChain leverages the best aspects of PoW, that is, using hashing of
the staking node’s ID for block creation while focusing the majority of
the consensus on Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The major improvement in the PoW
mechanism for DeFiChain is that staking nodes can run without investing
in high-end servers and ultra-fast bandwidth connections. Thus,
DeFiChain is creating the potential for easier and faster
decentralization of the mode ownership and infrastructure.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-non-turing-complete-smart-contracts">4. Non-Turing-complete Smart Contracts<a class="hash-link" href="#4-non-turing-complete-smart-contracts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Decentralized financial transactions are implemented through smart
contracts. For example to ensure that borrowers repay lenders, smart
contracts implement the conditions of lending in the code. For smart
contract development, DeFiChain will be adding opcode support for
decentralized financial instruction sets. The DeFi opcode complements
and works in tangent with the Script scripting language of the existing
Bitcoin Core protocol.</p><p>The DeFi scripting language is called Recipe, denoting the language’s
role in describing and allowing for decentralized financial contracts.</p><p>Bitcoin Script instruction words usually start with the prefix <code>OP_*</code>.
Recipe instruction words carry the prefix <code>DF_*</code>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-immutable-through-block-anchoring">5. Immutable through Block Anchoring<a class="hash-link" href="#5-immutable-through-block-anchoring" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>While the common discussion of immutability is a binary conversation (a
blockchain is either immutable or not), in fact, immutability is on a
spectrum. The level of immutability of a blockchain is related to the
cost of a rollback or “fork out” of mined blocks, also known as a 51%
attack.</p><p>It takes time to amass significant miners or minters to make 51% attack
costly enough that it is generally regarded as immutable, meaning that a
new blockchain is automatically at a disadvantage when it comes to the
immutability of the records. Some newer blockchains have been taking
shortcuts to increase its immutability quality, typically by
compromising on decentralization. For example, the chains may allow only
delegated stakers chosen by the founders, or by making the blockchain
permissioned instead of permissionless.</p><p>DeFiChain aims to maintain decentralization quality while maintaining
immutability. To do so, DeFiChain will anchor its block to Bitcoin
blockchain every few blocks. This further enhances the immutability of
DeFiChain without any compromise to the decentralized nature of the
chain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consensus-algorithm">Consensus Algorithm<a class="hash-link" href="#consensus-algorithm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Stake<a class="hash-link" href="#proof-of-stake" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>DeFiChain utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm similar to Bitcoin
Core’s original Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm. While DeFiChain is
choosing PoS over PoW, at the same time, DeFi technology retains the
best of the tested and proven technologies that were developed in the
Bitcoin Core blockchain.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="masternodes-for-staking">Masternodes for Staking<a class="hash-link" href="#masternodes-for-staking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>To run a masternode (staking node), stakers must hold a fixed amount of
DFI, initially set at 1,000,000. Masternodes on DeFiChain participate in
active transaction validations and block creations. The staking amount
is intended to be lowered with the stability and maturity of blockchain
to encourage further decentralization.</p><p>Each staking node can perform only 1 hash per second, with the nonce
from Bitcoin Core PoW algorithm replaced by a staker’s UTXO.</p><p>A new block is mined if it satisfies the following condition:</p><p><code>SHA256({staker’s UTXO}, {current timestamp, in seconds}, {stake modifier}) &lt; {target}</code></p><p>The stakers check this requirement each second. If the block condition
is less than the current target, then the stakers assemble and sign a
new block.</p><p>Staker’s UTXO require 20 confirmations before it can be accepted as a
stake.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stake-modifier">Stake Modifier<a class="hash-link" href="#stake-modifier" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>A stake modifier is a collective source of random entropy. Without a
stake modifier, the future PoS kernel would be completely predictable. A
good stake modifier needs to be neither predictable nor influance-able
by stakers.</p><p>DeFiChain’s staker modifier is set to be
<code>SHA256({previous stake modifier}, {masternode ID})</code>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="validation-of-future-and-past-headers">Validation of Future and Past Headers<a class="hash-link" href="#validation-of-future-and-past-headers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Unlike PoW, block header validation requires a stakes table. Headers get
verified in batches before full blocks are downloaded, so the stakes
table is used to verify future stakes.</p><p>To be able to verify future headers, the blockchain needs to apply an
additional rule, so any change of the stakes database gets written right
away, but takes effect only after 300 blocks. As a result, any node will
be able to verify any block header against its current stake, if a block
header isn’t further in the future (or in the past) than 300 blocks.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nothing-at-stake-protection">Nothing at Stake Protection<a class="hash-link" href="#nothing-at-stake-protection" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>For PoS blockchains, there’s no limit to how many conflicting blocks a
staker may sign. As a result, stakers may stake for every possible fork
or branch, which weakens the finality of a PoS blockchain. This problem
is known as a double-sign and is not possible in PoW blockchains, where
a miner cannot mine all the possible branches without splitting mining
capability. In PoW, this represents an intrinsic economic penalty.
However, PoS blockchains cannot apply an inherent economic penalty for
signing conflicting blocks on different branches.</p><p>Therefore, in order to enhance the finality of DeFiChain, in PoS, it’s
necessary to detect double-signs and penalize them through an explicit
mechanism.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detection-of-double-sign">Detection of Double-sign<a class="hash-link" href="#detection-of-double-sign" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Each block header has a sequence number as a number of blocks that a
particular staker has minted before a particular block. If two blocks
are minted with the same sequence number, it means that a staker has
double-signed, even if the blocks have different ancestors, i.e. across
branches.</p><p>During a block’s generation, a staker has the right to include the
double-sign proofs into his block header in exchange for only half of
the penalty.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="double-sign-penalty">Double-sign Penalty<a class="hash-link" href="#double-sign-penalty" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>To be able to apply a penalty to stakers who double-sign, DeFiChain has
to disallow immediate withdrawing of stake. Thus, when a deactivation
transaction is confirmed, DeFiChain requires 3000 blocks to pass. At a
block time of 30 seconds, 3000 blocks is equivalent to 25 hours.</p><p>The double-sign penalty is 10 times the block rewards, deducted from the
collateral. This also disqualifies the stakers from further staking
immediately. The staker wanting to get back to staking has to re-put in
fresh stake UTXO of 1,000,000 DFI. Running the official DeFiChain node
does not cause any unintentional or accidental double-sign. Double-sign
happens only in cases of malicious intent.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-drift-attack">Time Drift Attack<a class="hash-link" href="#time-drift-attack" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The chain uses a maximum future block time of only approx. 5 seconds, to
protect the chain from time drift attacks, where stakers set a block
time too far ahead in the future, in order to claim a reward for
themselves. DeFi also uses NTP time synchronization to allow for ongoing
adjustment to the block time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bitcoin-anchoring">Bitcoin Anchoring<a class="hash-link" href="#bitcoin-anchoring" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DeFiChain stakers publish blockchain block hashes periodically to the
Bitcoin blockchain, providing public audit and block anchoring of
DeFiChain to the strongest, most secure blockchain in the world.</p><p>Every 60 blocks (approximately 30 minutes), a staker gets the right to
write the Merkle root of the previous block onto the Bitcoin blockchain.
The information written is, specifically, the txid of the Bitcoin
transaction, Bitcoin block header and Merkle proof containing the Merkle
root onto the newly mined block. By doing so, the staker will be
rewarded an extra block reward in DFI, incentivising nodes to regularly
anchor all records to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_5_Every-60-blocks-c7928b3e51a46627d98359805d95bcd1.png" width="1200" height="580" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>DeFiChain node will include a built-in Bitcoin Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) client.

in a trustless manner and allow trustless financial contracts and
trading of all major cryptoasset tokens. The token standards are similar
to ERC20 on Ethereum and Omni on Bitcoin blockchain. Through this
standard, DeFiChain allows tokenization of any assets.</p><p>On DeFiChain the standardized tokens are called DeFi Standard Token
(DST). DST tokens are of two different types: DCT, created by users of
the system, and DAT, which are asset-backed tokens created with the
backing of cryptoassets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_6_Custom-token-b2849298967993fad38ae60ee90352ce.png" width="1200" height="576" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defi-custom-token-dct">DeFi Custom Token (DCT)<a class="hash-link" href="#defi-custom-token-dct" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DCTs are custom tokens that can be created by any user to represent any
project or set of smart contracts implemented on DeFiChain. Any user can
create such a DCT. To prevent abuse, creation of any proprietary DCT
requires the user to lock up 1,000 DFI for the time that the tokens are
issued. The DFI is returned when the tokens are revoked and the DCT is
cancelled.</p><p>DCT tokens are not backed intrinsically by DeFiChain. They may be backed
through an external mechanism, but it’s essential to note that DeFiChain
does not intrinsically back them. An example on the Ethereum blockchain
would be DGX, which is an ERC20 token backed by gold. Ethereum does not
back DGX, although the token is created through ERC20. The Digix
Foundation is accountable for the value of that token. Similarly, DCT is
the DeFi parallel to ERC20 on Ethereum. Creation and issuance of tokens
on DeFi is simplified and the potential for errors in the smart contract
is eliminated, because creators of DCT can set only the parameters

generated.</li><li>Initial distribution list: List of addresses for distribution of
tokens.</li><li>Minting support: yes/no</li><li>Final supply limit (optional): Immutable total supply limit. If
minting is supporting this will define the ceiling on how many tokens
the token owner can mint in total (some may be reserved at this time).
If this parameter is left blank, this is an unlimited supply token.
This cannot be changed after the initial definition of the token.</li><li>Tradeability: yes/no. This is a one-way switch allowing the token
owner to transfer tokens during initial distribution period and also
to decide when a token is tradeable/movable. To ensure the
decentralized nature of DCT, once “tradeability” is set to yes, the
owner is no longer able to reverse the tradability of a token.
Typically, when creating a token, this should be turned to “no” until
the initial distribution is confirmed to be accurate.</li></ul><p>Using this interface, there is no need to have a smart contract

DATs on
DeFiChain are tokens and crypto assets external of DeFiChain, such as:</p><ul><li>DBTC, backed by BTC</li><li>DETH, backed by ETH</li><li>DXRP, backed by XRP</li><li>DUSDT, backed by USDT</li><li>DBCH, backed by BCH, etc.</li></ul><p>New DATs are introduced to the system through voting by masternodes.
This ensures that only assets that gather the most interest amongst
DeFiChain users get introduced.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="economic-pegging-of-dats">Economic Pegging of DATs<a class="hash-link" href="#economic-pegging-of-dats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The goal of DAT is to have it represent the native asset on the other
blockchains, e.g. 1 DBTC should represent 1 BTC.</p><p>There are two approaches to this:</p><ol><li>Stablecoin approach<ul><li>For every single issued 1 DBTC, 1 BTC has to be locked up in an
address or a smart contract.</li><li>While this would help to build a guarantee to DBTC, it introduces
some other issues – country-party risks and affect the
decentralized nature of DeFi.</li></ul></li><li>Economic pegging<ul><li>By providing a strong guarantee that the DAT representing an asset
has its price closely tracking the native asset, i.e. by holding
DBTC, one can have a good confidence that the value of DBTC will
track that of BTC.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In order for us to achieve economic pegging, the following building
blocks are built natively on DeFiChain:</p><ol><li>Loan Contract</li><li>Decentralized Exchange (DEX)</li><li>Cross-chain Exchange (XCX)</li><li>Pricing Oracles</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_7_Dat-overview-d26d54f9b0402d9375482e75d3dfb1ba.png" width="1200" height="608" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="loan-contract">Loan Contract<a class="hash-link" href="#loan-contract" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Loan Contract is designed to allow the owner of the contract to take a
collateralized loan against collateral locked in the contract. Each loan
contract is unique to every owner (address) on DeFiChain.</p><p>Any user can open a loan contract on DeFiChain, free of charge. The user
who opens a loan contract owns the specific contract. This ownership,
however, is transferable.</p><p>Once a loan contract is opened, DFI can be sent to fund the loan
collateral. Once a loan contract is funded, it allows the owner to take
out a loan by minting DATs up to a certain collateralization ratio. The
minimum collateralization ratio can be adjusted by DeFiChain DAO and
starts at 150%. In other words, \$1,500 worth of collateral (in DFI),
allows the loan contract owner to take out a maximum of \$1,000 in
loans.</p><p>Minted DATs are subject to a floating borrowing rate. A loan contract
has no expiry date. The owner is able to take out a loan for as long as
they desire, as long as the collateralization ratio stays above 150% at
all times.</p><p><code>Collateralization ratio = Collateral / (Loan + accrued interest)</code></p><p>If a loan contract falls below the 150% collateralization ratio at any
point in time, its collateral is liquidated via Decentralized Exchange
(DEX) to pay off accrued interest. There will be an additional 15%
liquidation penalty to discourage loan contracts from having to be
liquidated. It is the responsibility of the loan contract owners to
monitor the collateralization ratio to prevent an unwanted liquidation.</p><p>If a loan contract is close to minimum collateralization ratio, the
owner must take one of the following steps to prevent liquidation and
having to incur 15% liquidation penalty:</p><ol><li>Deposit more DFI into the loan contract, thereby increasing its
collateral and collateralization ratio.</li><li>Pay back some of the loan (or accrued interest), thereby decreasing
the loan contract’s loan amount and increasing its collateralization
ratio.</li></ol><p>Closing a loan contract entitles its owner to get back all 100% of its
collateral. To close a loan contract, the owner has to pay back the loan
in full, plus the accrued interest in its entity in the DAT (e.g. DBTC).
Upon liquidation of the loan, the minted DAT is burned, and the initial
minted DAT and the interest will be converted into DFI via the DeFi DEX
described in this paper.</p><p>While this concept is not new to the DeFi system, what is novel is the
possibility to collateralize any asset due to DeFiChain’s nature.</p><ol><li>Alice opens a loan contract and funds it with 150k DFI.</li><li>With DFI at \$0.10 spot rate, Alice’s loan contract now has \$15,000
worth of collateral.</li><li>At the minimum collateralization ratio of 150% she can take out a
maximum of \$10,000 worth of DBTC, which is pegged to BTC spot
price.</li><li>Since the DBTC loan via loan contract accrues interest, and DBTC and
the DFI price fluctuate, Alice decides to only take out \$5,000
worth of DBTC, i.e. 0.5 DBTC, giving her loan contract a
collateralization ratio of: 15000/5000 = 300%, well above 150%.</li><li>Over-collateralization allows for some room for price movements of
DBTC. If the BTC price increases to \$15,000, Alice’s loan of 0.5
DBTC would now be worth \$7,500. Her loan contract now has a
collateralization ratio of: 15000/7500 = 200%, still above 150%, so
liquidation would not be triggered even in the case of this type of
price shift.</li><li>The interest rate for each DAT loan differs. Assuming the DBTC loan
rate is 5% annually, taking out a loan for a year, in order to close
her loan contract and to fully redeem her initial 150k DFI, Alice
has to pay back 0.5 DBTC <!-- -->*<!-- --> 1.05 = 0.525 DBTC by the end of the

href="#decentralized-exchange-dex" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The DeFi internal DEX provides decentralized trading for all DeFi tokens
and DFI itself, which means that all tokens: DFI and DCT (DAT and DCT)
can be listed on DeFiChain DEX. DEX will initially launch with DFI as
the base trading pair, providing markets such as DBTC/DFI, DETH/DFI,
DUSDT/DFI, etc. With increasing volume, other base trading pairs can be
introduced, subject to a DAO approval, providing markets such as
DETH/DBTC, DFI/DUSDT, etc.</p><p>DEX on DeFiChain operates without the need to pass custody to any
intermediaries. Users are able to trade on their own in a trustless
manner. One of the key differentiator about DeFiChain as compared to
many other decentralized financial solutions is that DeFiChain is not
only a consensus protocol facilitating DeFi, it is also comes with a
very simple to use client user interface (UI) that allows users to
interact directly on the blockchain without any intermediaries.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cross-chain-exchange-xcx">Cross-chain Exchange (XCX)<a class="hash-link" href="#cross-chain-exchange-xcx" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A user holding DBTC might be interested in holding of actual BTC instead
of a DeFi pegged BTC token (DBTC).</p><p>The DeFi Cross-chain Exchange (XCX) allows anyone to do exactly that.
XCX allows listing of DATs with its native tokens, e.g. DBTC for BTC,
DETH for ETH, DXRP for XRP. Actual transaction is carried out through
the trustless swap of both tokens commonly known as atomic swap. Atomic
swap guarantees that either both parties receive their exchanged coins,
or neither transactions go through – providing a strong cryptographic
guarantee that no one party is able to cheat the other.</p><p>We use the following terms to describe the parties in the XCX:</p><ul><li>Borrower: a person owning a DAT and wanting to get a native coin, e.g,
a person who has DBTC and wanting to obtain BTC through the XCX.</li><li>Lender: a person owning BTC and receiving a DAT through the XCX,
either temporarily for the duration of the XCX, or permanently, if the
XCX expires.</li></ul><p>XCX orders contain several parameters that can be freely decided by the
market marker (first lister of an order). For selling of DBTC for BTC
(i.e. someone who’s interested in receiving actual BTC), the parameters
are:</p><ul><li>Amount: Amount of coin/DAT a seller is looking for and how much DAT is
locked up.</li><li>Premium: Amount of additional fee a coin seller stands to make from
this trade (Premium is listed per unit amount, thus allowing for
partial fulfillment of trade orders). Together with expiry, it can
also be considered as lending interest to the buyer. The Premium is
paid instantly once an XCX is matched, before expiry of the lending
contract. Premium can be positive (+) or negative (-) depending on
supply and demand.</li><li>Guarantee: An optional additional amount in DBTC and/or DFI that is
locked in the XCX that will provide an extra incentive for a lender as
it resolves in either of the following two outcomes: a. Released back
to the borrower should the BTC amount be paid up before expiry. b.
Release to the lender should the contract expire without the borrower
making a payment thereby constituting an extra incentive.</li><li>Expiry: Time when the contract expires, it can be set as a date in the
past for immediate settlement, i.e. no lending, but straight-out swap.</li><li>Native token address: Address to send BTC to for executing the
contract.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-example">First Example:<a class="hash-link" href="#first-example" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Alice has 1 DBTC and wants 1 BTC so she can trade on a centralized

indeed sent the amount as agreed and the that the txid is valid.</li><li>XCX’s premium of 8000 DFI is instantly released to Bob. Bob can do
what he wants with the DFI straight away with no strings attached.
It is Bob’s to keep for this trade.</li></ol><p>Now, Alice has 1 BTC and Bob has 8000 DFI. Alice also has 1 DBTC locked
up on XCX order and Bob is the beneficiary of that BTC. Note that the
beneficiary of an XCX is transferable, i.e. Bob is able to sell the XCX
with Alice to a third party (this allows for decentralized debt selling
and tokenization of receivables).</p><p>Should Alice wish to redeem her 1 DBTC from the XCX before the time is
up, Alice will send Bob the 1 BTC she borrowed earlier to Bob’s address
specified in the XCX and send the acknowledgment on DeFiChain. Upon
confirmation by stakers with a BTC bridge, the XCX contract now closes
and Alice gets her 1 DBTC back, having paid 8,000 DFIs as interest.</p><p>Bob gets his 1 BTC back (keeping his 8000 DFI as lending interest).</p><p>Should Alice wish not to redeem the XCX before the expiry, Bob gets to
keep Alice’s 1 DBTC.</p><p>Alice gets to keep the 1 BTC (minus 8000 DFI interest) and Bob now gets
1 DBTC (plus 8000 DFI interest). Additionally Bob received the Guarantee
of 0.1 DBTC providing him with an extra 10%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/whitepaper_EN_9_Alice-bob-xcx-26c4ae206f92d0add800c8e11ea18b87.png" width="1200" height="988" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-example">Second Example:<a class="hash-link" href="#second-example" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In a second scenario Charlie has 1 DBTC and wants 1 BTC. He has no
intention of paying it back and getting his DBTC back. He also does not
want to include an additional guarantee, so he adds a higher Premium and
an immediate Expiry. Charlie would list the following XCX order:</p><ul><li>Amount: 1 DBTC/BTC</li><li>Premium: 12000 DFI</li><li>Guarantee: None</li><li>Expiry: Immediate</li></ul><p>Dave, notices the order has no guarantee and an immediate expiry and
knows that this XCX order expires instantly. He happily provides the
counter-trade to Charlie, giving him 1 BTC and receiving immediately 1
DBTC + 12000 DFI.</p><p>A Guarantee is therefore not a must, but a potential incentive for the
lender to know whether he/she has to exchange the received funds
afterwards or whether he/she will get the original native coins back.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pricing-oracles">Pricing Oracles<a class="hash-link" href="#pricing-oracles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A Pricing Contract is a smart contract on DeFiChain allowing multiple

200 DFI block reward for at least 1,050,000 blocks since the the first
genesis block, so approximately 1 year.</p><p>Subsequently, block rewards will be adjusted through governance vote.
The Foundation also further pledges that there will never be more than

governance votes to change this limit. Therefore DFI is a deflationary
utility token.</p><p>The proposed staking schedule for the first 10 years is according to the

of Bitcoin can harness almost the entire crypto market without being
limited to “smaller” chains like Ethereum etc. Thus, as of publication,
the target market for DeFiChain are over 60-80 million cryptocurrency
owners and we can expect that hundreds of millions of other users will
join in the future. This group of investors is investing and holding
cryptocurrency due to the returns as well as their belief in the future
of the industry. As investors, they have widely done well with the rise
in many of the cryptoassets, however, they are not able to use their
holdings in order to get better returns. Providing DeFi services will
allow these investors to hold the coins they believe in, and increase
their holdings over time based on investments that go deeper than just
currency trading.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="go-to-market-strategy">Go-to-market Strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#go-to-market-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The initial DeFiChain team is made up of some of the top names in the
cryptocurrency industry, people who have made a name for themselves not
just by delivering on their promises, but by creating a following. The
team has built up a variety of marketing channels and has an established
following on social media, wide distribution of books in the area of
cryptocurrency, and deep contacts within the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>With the experience of building up social media followings of hundreds
of thousands of users in the course of just a few years, the team plans
to leverage their current followers and bring them onto specific
channels that will be the domain of DeFiChain. The team will build up a
complete marketing engine and staff, using the same proven competence
they displayed in the past.</p><p>Unlike other blockchains, DeFiChain will be balanced between marketing
and technology expertise. Building the best network is only half of the
job. DFI holders can rest assured that the marketing team has the proven
experience in building up a marketing engine that is required for
product success and that the tech team will be able to deliver on the
roadmap.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="partnerships">Partnerships<a class="hash-link" href="#partnerships" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The DeFiChain Foundation will be tasked with assessing applications from
ecosystem partners and providing foundation grants in the form of \$DFI
coins to developers and contributors to DeFiChain. Many open source
projects and blockchain developers today are looking for the right
blockchain project in order to develop their DeFi applications, and the
prospect of a dedicated DeFiChain, backed by industry leaders is
appealing.</p><p>The DeFiChain Foundation will undertake a variety of efforts to choose
the best projects for the expansion of DeFiChain:</p><ul><li>Creation of a formal application process so that worthy projects can
apply for airdrop or foundation grants for their development</li><li>Approaching developers in the ecosystem who are doing DeFi dApps on
other blockchains, and providing grants for them to develop their
dApps on DeFi.</li><li>General marketing to get the word out about the availability of

benefits not only for first-world areas, but moreover also all those
that need decentralized finance the most. For example, imagine Anna, who
owns a small business in a developing economy, but who doesn’t have a
traditional bank account. She uses mobile money and digital currencies
to run her business, accepting payments through mobile–which makes
perfect sense, because nobody in her province uses cash or credit cards.
Anna uses DeFiChain to take out a loan when one of her suppliers pays
late, saving her business. In the old days, she would have simply gone
out of business, because no bank would loan money to her. Anna also
invests wisely. When she is paid by the supplier, she immediately moves
the cash into various tokenized assets to avoid the hyperinflation and
instability of her national government’s currency, and on top of that,
she is able to earn interest.</p><p>Anna creates a group of local businesspeople, and together they pool
funds to help other entrepreneurs in their village. They purchase office
space, solar panels, and a satellite to create a business center. The
group uses DeFi to eliminate the overhead of complex legal contracts
between them. They receive automatic dividends when the business center
profits. Some of them reinvest in a delivery drone which charges for its
services, and distributes the income to the investors. Others invest in
sensor equipment that test local soil conditions, and sell the data to
commodity markets. All of the sensors work independently and charge
independently, and the investors simply reap the profits, all calculated
automatically on DeFiChain.</p><p>Now, 5 years after her initial use of DeFi, Anna is able to take out a
loan with no collateral, based on her long-term record of smart
investments and returning loans on time, as well as assessment of her
industry from trusted oracles. It’s a win-win situation. The lenders
come from all over the globe, from people who want to diversify their
investment portfolio to developing economies. The lenders don’t have to
worry about the complexity of cross-border transactions or legal
requirements. They escape the banking systems of their own countries,
which moved to zero and negative-interest rates on savings. Now, these
regular investors can be assured of returns on investments based on Anna
and people like her, who run great businesses and can provide returns on
people’s investments.</p><p>This is what DeFiChain is all about - To make the world a better place!</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div
