DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It describes the idea of enabling people to become their own bank for these services and eliminate counterparty risks, without the need for a trusted third party to run financial services.

## So what is DeFiChain?

Decentralized financial services rely on blockchain technology to provide a secure, fast, and accessible infrastructure.

While the Bitcoin blockchain was originally designed for decentralized and censorship-resistant value storage, it lacks the capabilities necessary for other DeFi services. Ethereum, while able to handle a wide range of functions, has faced security issues with its smart contracts.

:::info The solution
DeFiChain aims to solve these problems by creating a blockchain specifically for DeFi services that prioritizes **security**, **speed**, and **accessibility**.

It also allows investors in the cryptocurrency market to generate **passive income** through staking and liquidity mining, regardless of market conditions.

### DeFiChain highlights

- Decentralized Loans
- Decentralized wrapping of tokens
- Oracles for decentralized price determination
- Decentralized exchanges (DEX)
- Transferable payables and receivables
- Decentralized unsecured debt
- Asset tokenization
- Profit distribution

## Technical origin

DeFiChain is built on top of Bitcoin, using a fork of Bitcoin's code. Its native coin, DFI, was distributed through staking rather than an initial coin offering (ICO). This means, that the price of DFI was only ever set by real supply and demand.

DeFiChain's MainNet has been live since May 2020, and its network benefits from Bitcoin's strong security and high hashing power. Additionally, DeFiChain offers low fees and fast transaction speeds due to its use of the Proof of Stake algorithm.

Overall, DeFiChain combines the security and power of Bitcoin with the scalability of Proof of Stake, enabling efficient and cost-effective transactions in the DeFi space.

### A Short Introduction {#a-short-introduction}

DeFiChain has been designed specifically for decentralized finance, and it has its own blockchain. To make our blockchain stronger, it is connected, in a way, to the Bitcoin blockchain for extra security and safety, as Bitcoin has the oldest and arguably the most secure existing blockchain.

The main coin of DeFiChain is DFI,

DFI is the native coin of the blockchain. A native coin is basically the currency of the blockchain. To make some examples, ETH is Ethereum's native coin, and BTC is Bitcoin's native coin. An example of a non-native coin (which is called a token) is SHIB on the Ethereum blockchain. Just to clarify, SHIB is a token. Anything that is not native to a blockchain is a token. All transactions on the blockchain are powered by native coins. So, users must have DFI for transaction fees on DeFiChain, swapping between coins, and more. It can be compared to the euro in the E.U., peso in Mexico, or U.S. dollar in the U.S.; people must have it to interact with the economy.

Here on DeFiChain, we also have non-native coins. We have decentralized tokens (non-native coins) that represent real stocks, 150% backed by people providing collateral, and tokens that represent real crypto and are 100% backed by the real asset. These tokens are like sending around assets in the real world. In the U.S. you pay dollars as fees/commissions for sending things around like real estate, stocks, etc, and that is how it is like in DeFiChain. The goal of our community is to make a world of decentralized finance, where everyone can interact with each other without having middlemen such as companies and organizations.

There will be more information about the non-native tokens on DeFiChain in the section titled "The DeFiChain Ecosystem."
