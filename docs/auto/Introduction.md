DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It describes the idea of enabling people to become their own bank for these services and eliminate counterparty risks, without the need for a trusted third party to run financial services.

## So what is DeFiChain?

Decentralized financial services rely on blockchain technology to provide a secure, fast, and accessible infrastructure.

While the Bitcoin blockchain was originally designed for decentralized and censorship-resistant value storage, it lacks the capabilities necessary for other DeFi services. Ethereum, while able to handle a wide range of functions, has faced security issues with its smart contracts.

:::info The solution
DeFiChain aims to solve these problems by creating a blockchain specifically for DeFi services that prioritizes **security**, **speed**, and **accessibility**.

It also allows investors in the cryptocurrency market to generate **passive income** through staking and liquidity mining, regardless of market conditions.

## Technical origin

DeFiChain is built on top of Bitcoin, using a fork of Bitcoin's code. Its native coin, DFI, was distributed through staking rather than an initial coin offering (ICO). This means, that the price of DFI was only ever set by real supply and demand.

DeFiChain's MainNet has been live since May 2020, and its network benefits from Bitcoin's strong security and high hashing power. Additionally, DeFiChain offers low fees and fast transaction speeds due to its use of the Proof of Stake algorithm.

Overall, DeFiChain combines the security and power of Bitcoin with the scalability of Proof of Stake, enabling efficient and cost-effective transactions in the DeFi space.
