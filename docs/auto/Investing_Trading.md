## **Part 1: Long and short positions with stock token**

With decentralized loans and assets on DefiChain, you can invest in different assets betting on increasing (long) or decreasing (short) prices. We will explain 3 different ways of investing.

### **Long position - Neutral DFI**
_Investment thesis:_  
The future price of an asset will be higher than it is today.

_DefiChain procedure:_

* Sell DFI on DEX for dUSD
* Buy your preferred asset on DEX with **x amount** of dUSD  
* Goal in the future
  * Sell asset for **y amount** of dUSD  
  * Profit: **(y-x)** dUSD

_Remarks:_
* Trades and profit are in dUSD
* DEX prices are relevant for the trade, not the price feed **→ pay attention of the pool ratio.**
* Any price movement of DFI will not have an effect on your investment
* Step 1 and 2 will be combined to a composite swap, which is only one step for the user
* Your complete capital is invested

_Example:_

With a DFI price of $2.50 you sell 280 DFI, and receive 700 dUSD. You buy 1 TSLA for those 700 dUSD and hold it.

After some time the TSLA price rises to 1000 dUSD and the DFI price to $4.00. Selling TSLA for dUSD gives you 1000 dUSD and you make 300 dUSD profit.

_Remark:_
* If you want to go back to DFI you will receive 250 DFI for the 1000 dUSD, because the price went up to $4.00.
**→ The best case for this investment: The asset price increases**
