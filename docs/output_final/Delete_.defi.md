Here I describe a solution that works from time to time when the DeFi
wallet does not start correctly. Sometimes even this approach does not
work. First, please make sure you have a secure backup.

Go to the .defi folder and delete the contents (or move the contents to
another location)

Windows: `C:\Users\%username%\.defi`

Mac: `/Users/%username%/.defi` [center\|thumb\|900x900px\|Delete or move
content](/File:210318_1607.png "wikilink")

If you can't find the .defi folder, this text may help: [Show hidden
folders](/Show_hidden_folders "wikilink")

Then restart the computer and open the DeFi Wallet. Partly this trick
works. If not we can only recommend to delete everything (except backup)
and reinstall the app.
