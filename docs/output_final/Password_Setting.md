The DefiChain app in version 2.3.0 offers or forces you to set a
password. This will encrypt your wallet.dat file where all sensitive
information, like private keys are stored. Since the leakage of the
private key will enable the attacker to transfer the funds from your
wallet to another one, encryption of the wallet is recommended and
implemented since the beginning. In former versions the was no GUI
support for this function and the command line was used to encrypt and
temporarily decrypt (as described
[here](https://github.com/DeFiCh/app/wiki/Wallet-Encryption)).

Please consider choosing a secure password to secure your wallet and
funds. Today is recommended to use long passwords instead of complex
passwords (as described in the NIST Password Guidelines, summarized e.g.
[here](https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/)).

To be able to transfer funds you need to unlock the wallet by clicking
the lock symbol and entering your password. This will unlock the wallet
for the time chosen in the settings. After that the wallet will lock
automatically. [none\|thumb\|549x549px\|Wallet
