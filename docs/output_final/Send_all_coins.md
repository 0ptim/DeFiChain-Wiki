Instructions how to send all coins and tokens of a DeFi Wallet:

Tokens](/File:210318_1518.png "wikilink") To move all assets it is best
to move the liquidity tokens first. To do this, open the corresponding
wallet and send the assets to the new address.

[center\|thumb\|900x900px\|Click on the DeFi Wallet and then click on

[center\|thumb\|900x900px\|Insert new address, click MAX, confirm note,
and then click Next and Send](/File:210318_1522.png "wikilink") Note:
Liquidity tokens may not be sent to exchanges or other providers. Send
liquidity tokens to your own address only!

After you have transferred the liquidity tokens to the new address, all
rewards will now also be distributed to the new address. Now you can
also transfer all other tokens like BTC or USDT.

Only when all other tokens have been transferred, you can transfer your
DFI last. The DFI only as last, because you need this as a means of
payment for the transaction fees.
