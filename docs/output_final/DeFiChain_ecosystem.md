[alt=DeFiChain ecosystem\|center\|thumb\|800x800px\|DeFiChain
ecosystem](/File:DefiChain_EcoSystem_1.02.jpg "wikilink") DeFiChain is a
SideChain to Bitcoin comparable to Bitcoin Liquid. Only DeFiChain
addresses can be used in the DeFi Wallet. The DFI Coin is accepted and
supported by many exchanges. The tokens are currently only accepted by
CAKE. So it is currently only possible to send BTC to a Bitcoin address
via CAKE. The team is working on a technical solution called Atomic Swap
to enable DeFi Wallet transaction directly into the Bitcoin network.
