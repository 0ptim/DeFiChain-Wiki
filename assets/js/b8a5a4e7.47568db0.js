When they are exchanged on the DEX, investors might realize that the price on the DEX might not be the same as the actual price. So, there are actually two different prices of assets on DeFiChain. The first is the real price of the asset, which decentralized bots known as oracles use data from exchanges (Binance), crypto data sites (CoinMarketCap), and/or the Nasdaq (for stocks and ETFs). This price is called the oracle price, and whenever a user mints tokens in their vault, they receive the token at this price. On the other hand, we have DEX prices, which change due to DeFiChain investors and supply and demand. Sometimes there is not enough supply/too much demand, which means that the DEX price of the asset will be higher than what the actual price or the oracle price is. Or, there may be too much supply/too little demand, meaning that the DEX price will be lower. When you are liquidity mining or holding tokens of an asset, you are mining at this price or can exchange your tokens at this DEX price. DEX prices are prevented from going out of control compared to the real asset for two reasons. In crypto tokenized assets, Cake allows investors to exchange the crypto asset at a 1 to 1 ratio for the tokenized asset on DeFiChain, creating an arbitrage opportunity if the price goes too far out from the actual price of the crypto asset.
